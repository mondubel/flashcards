# AI Rules for Flashcards

Flashcards is a web-based educational application designed to reduce the friction of creating high-quality flashcards for spaced repetition learning.
The core idea of the product is to use AI to generate flashcards from pasted text, allowing users to focus on learning rather than manual content preparation. Users can also create flashcards manually, manage their collection, and review cards using a spaced repetition algorithm based on Anki.

## Tech Stack

- Rails 8
- Tailwind 4

## Project Structure

When introducing changes to the project, always follow the directory structure below:

- `./app` – main application code
- `./app/controllers` – controllers handling requests and responses
- `./app/models` – application models and business logic
- `./app/views` – traditional Rails views (layouts, partials, templates)
- `./app/components` – view components
- `./app/javascript` – JavaScript frontend code
- `./app/assets` – internal assets
- `./config` – application configuration, routes, environments
- `./db` – database schema, migrations, seeds
- `./public` – public assets
- `./spec` – automated tests

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
