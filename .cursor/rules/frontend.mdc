## Frontend

### General Guidelines

- Use Rails views (.html.erb) for page-level composition
- Use ViewComponents instead of partials for reusable UI elements and layout composition
- Use Turbo for navigation, form submissions, and partial page updates
- Use Stimulus controllers only when JavaScript behavior is required, one responsibility per Stimulus controller
- Prefer Turbo Frames and Streams over custom JavaScript

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements
